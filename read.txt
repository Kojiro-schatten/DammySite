Hey, Guys. Thanks for viewing.
This File is that I used for learning pixel coding.
Using "pixel_coding_material.png", I made it.

Attention::
Some svg, font-text are not because of time. And up to 768px, I made originally.
 
Tools::
Mapture (https://anatoo.jp/mapture/)
Adobe XD
VS code
Sass

If you have time, let's try it! 
Thank you.
